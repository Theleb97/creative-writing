      "Bill hears a tapping on the window and then, it became a pitter-patter. So much rain is falling that the sound blurred into one long, whirring noise as if the sky tears up because of his imminent end. Well, he saved many poor children for free in his pediatric clinic. The prayers of their parents for him must relieve a part of his unbearable kidney cancer's pain. Since he has become bedridden, his memories as a successful surgeon keep spinning in his head. \n",
      "Shifts in the hospital had been overwhelming for the young resident. Bill had always impressed his superiors with his intelligence. However, his thirst for success had led him to an unforgivable sin.\n",
      "Suddenly, the door opens.\n",
      "- Do you need something, Sir?\n",
      "This was the nurse, Jessica charged to take care of Bill. Her angelic face has always been torture to the dying man. She looks like the little Emmy, his oblation for rapid success thirteen years ago. Every time he sees Jessica, he feels bitterness in his throat. Is God punishing him in his last days?\n",
      "It was the first day in the spring when a nine-year-old girl came to the hospital from the orphanage with respiratory issues. Bill was charged with her case and he diagnosed her with a genetic malformation in her heart. In the next room, a ten-year-old boy was waiting for a kidney transplant. His parents were ready to scarify their fortune to find a donor but there weren't any matches with their son. The hopeless mother was erring in the corridor when she saw Emmy alone in her bed and she had a diabolic idea: Emmy could be a donor! When Bill first heard her suggestion, he refused as the weak heart of the girl after the surgery would not afford to donate a kidney. However, the check full of zeros that the parents gave him made him think again. Is it ethical to let a boy with a caring family and a bright future die to save a miserable girl? Finally, Bill did the tests hoping not to find a match but, the analysis deceived him. To alleviate his guilt, the doctor convinced himself that fate was drawing this tragedy and he could not change it. Even though he was not the surgeon of the transplant, he thought he was a murder. The day after the surgery, Emmy was suffering from hard complications. She was taking her last breathe when Bill left her room, not able to witness the scene. Although the huge money he earned, he always has felt bitterness in his success later. Something died inside him.\n",
      "- No, thanks Jessica, answered Bill coldly.\n",
      "How can she look like Emmy so accurately? What if Emmy did not die and returns for revenge. \n",
      "- Emmy? Bill yells.\n",
      "But, the nurse looks at him weirdly and says:\n",
      "- I am Jessica, Sir.\n",
      "This must be the effect of the pain-releaving drugs, he thought. He closes his eyes and relapses in his memories.\n",

This is someone who sure likes his job, thinks Charles. Being unemployed in 1920 is not an easy situation, and Charles, a former philosophy teacher, sure does know that.\n",

You can take a walk, it’s a great opportunity to stretch your legs\" said Fred. After picking up his tools box, he shows the example by getting out first. \n",
      "Everyone steps outside the bus, except John, busy and focused on a notebook. Judging by its cover showing the Boston P.D. initials, he must be working on a case. It is still summer, but the leaves have already begun to turn red, which gives the landscape some powerful colours. Katherine, aware of that, starts to draw what she sees. Martin gives his help to Fred, who refused: he knows his vehicle like no one else and can handle it alone. Charles tries to break the ice. \"Have you ever heard of Kant? His Categorical Imperative as a model of morality is impressive\". The long silence following says that they don’t know about Kant and probably don’t care about it either. \n",

Once arrived in Boston they all went on different path to their homes. They didn’t get to know each other. They were stranger, insignificant for their life.\n",

So a lot rain is falling that the sound blurred into one retentive, whirring noise as if the sky tears up because of his at hand end. Well, he saved many piteous children for absolve in his pediatric clinic. The prayers of their parents for him must relieve a part of his unbearable kidney cancer's pain. Since he has become bedridden, his memories as a successful surgeon keep spinning in his head. Shifts in the hospital had been overwhelming for the Whitney Young resident. Bill had always impressed his superiors with his intelligence. However, his thirst for success had led him to an inexcusable sin. Suddenly, the door opens. - do you need something, Sir this was the nurse, Jessica charged to take care of Bill. Her cherubic face has always been torture to the dying man. She looks like the picayune Emmy, his oblation for speedy success thirteen years ago. Every time he sees Jessica, he feels bitterness in his throat. Is God punishing him in his stopping point days it was the first base day in the spring when a nine-year-old girl came to the hospital from the orphanage with respiratory issues. Bill was charged with her case and he diagnosed her with a transmissible malformation in her heart. In the next room, a ten-year-old boy was waiting for a kidney transplant. His parents were quick to scarify their fortune to find a donor but there weren't any matches with their son. The hopeless mother was erring in the corridor when she saw Emmy alone in her bed and she had a unholy idea Emmy could be a donor when Bill first heard her suggestion, he refused as the fallible heart of the girl after the surgery would not afford to donate a kidney. However, the check to the full of zeros that the parents gave him made him think again. Is it honourable to let a boy with a caring family and a hopeful future die to save a piteous girl Finally, Bill did the tests hoping not to find a match but, the analysis deceived him. To alleviate his guilt, the doctor convinced himself that fate was drawing this tragedy and he could not change it. Even though he was not the surgeon of the transplant, he thought he was a murder. The day after the surgery, Emmy was suffering from heavy complications. She was taking her final stage breathe when Bill left her room, not capable to witness the scene. Although the huge money he earned, he always has felt bitterness in his success later. Something died inside him. - no, thanks Jessica, answered Bill coldly. How can she look like Emmy so accurately what if Emmy did not die and returns for revenge. - emmy Bill Yells. But, the harbour looks at him weirdly and says - i am Jessica, Sir. This must be the effect of the pain-releaving drugs, he thought. He closes his eyes and relapses in his memories.\""

The prayers of their parents for him must ease a part of his unbearable kidney cancer's pain. Since he has become bedridden, his memories as a successful surgeon livelihood spinning in his head. Shifts in the hospital had been overwhelming for the young resident. Bill had always impressed his superiors with his intelligence. However, his thirst for success had led him to an unforgivable sin. Suddenly, the door opens.- Do you penury something, Sir? This was the nurse, Jessica charged to drive care of Bill. Her angelic face has always been torture to the dying man. She looks like the little Emmy, his oblation for rapid success thirteen years ago. Every time he sees Jessica, he feels bitterness in his throat. Is God punishing him in his last days? It was the first day in the spring when a nine-year-old girl came to the hospital from the orphanage with respiratory issues. Bill was charged with her case and he diagnosed her with a genetic malformation in her heart. In the next room, a ten-year-old boy was waiting for a kidney transplant. His parents were ready to scarify their fortune to line up a donor but there weren't any matches with their son. The hopeless mother was erring in the corridor when she saw Emmy alone in her bed and she had a diabolic idea: Emmy could beryllium a donor!

Finally, Bill did the tests hoping not to obtain a match but, the analysis deceived him. To facilitate his guilt, the doctor convinced himself that fate was drawing this tragedy and he could not transfer it. Even though he was not the surgeon of the transplant, he thought he was a murder. The day after the surgery, Emmy was suffering from hard complications. She was taking her last breathe when Bill left her room, not able to see the scene. Although the huge money he earned, he always has felt bitterness in his success later. Something died inside him.- No, thanks Jessica, answered Bill coldly. How can she flavor like Emmy so accurately? What if Emmy did not give-up the ghost and returns for revenge.- Emmy? Bill yells. But, the nurse looks at him weirdly and says:- I am Jessica, Sir. This must comprise the effect of the pain-releaving drugs, he thought. He closes his eyes and relapses in his memories.\""
